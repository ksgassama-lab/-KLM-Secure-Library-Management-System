# 📚 KLM: Library Management System
**Platform:** Appian (Low-Code)

### Project overviw
This is a digital library system I built to help librarians manage their books and members. Instead of using paper or spreadsheets, this app handles everything—from adding new books to approving rental requests.

### Key Features
- **Book Catalog:** A list of all books (`KLM Book Detail`).
- **Rental Requests:** Clients can ask to borrow books (`KLM Book Rent Request`).
- **Supervisor Reviews:** A manager must approve or deny the request (`KLM_SupervisorRequestReview`).
- **Auto-Returns:** The system automatically "returns" books when the time is up (`KLM Scheduler to Return Books`).
